# Ownership

- Ownership is at the core of Rust and one of its unique features
- It's a unique memory allocation mechanism different from manual allocation and from garbage collection
- Manual allocation can be difficult and error-prone
- Garbage collection is reliable and automatic, but it impacts performance (although negligibly most of the times) since the program has to periodically check unused memory and free it
