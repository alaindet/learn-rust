# Data types
- Data types describe the "category" of a variable (string, number etc)
- Data types can be
  - **scalar** representing a single value; Rust has four scalar types:
    - integers
    - floating-point numbers
    - booleans
    - characters
  - **compound** representing a related group of values; Rust has two primitive compound types:
    - tuples
    - arrays

## Scalar: Integer
